# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to visually show the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days and the tectonic plates’ location on the earth. 

## Challenge Overview

Create an earthquake map with three different bases: streets, satellite, and dark. Create three overlays: a) earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days, b) the tectonic plates’ location on the earth, and c) all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. Colors and radius of the circle markers are based on the magnitude of earthquake. Also, a popup marker for each earthquake displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake. 

## Resources

- Software: JavaScript, D3.js, Leaflet map, HTML, mapBox.
- Data Source: GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website. Tectonic plate data from github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates. 

### Methods

- JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes. 

- Leaflet library to plot the data on the Mapbox map and interactivity for the earthquake data.

- Mapbox account to get the API token for creating the geographical maps.

- The tectonic plate data from github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates. 

- Geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days from USGS GeoJSON earthquake data.
